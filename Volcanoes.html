<p>This is the Pinatubo Volcano.</p>
<p>Mount Pinatubo is an active stratovolcano located on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is situated at the tripoint of the provinces of Zambales, Tarlac, and Pampanga. Mount Pinatubo is known for its catastrophic eruption in June 1991, which was one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The eruption of Mount Pinatubo had a significant impact on the surrounding environment and communities. The eruption produced a massive ash cloud that reached heights of up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) into the atmosphere, leading to widespread ashfall in the surrounding areas. The eruption also caused pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanic mudflows), and significant changes to the landscape.</p>
