    </center>
    <p>There are several types of volcanoes, each characterized by their shape, size, and eruption style. The main types include:</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style=" font-size: 30px;">1. Shield Volcanoes</h2>
    <p>Shield volcanoes have broad, gentle slopes and are built up by the flow of low-viscosity lava. They often produce large, fluid lava flows that can cover extensive areas. An example of a shield volcano is Mauna Loa in Hawaii.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style=" font-size: 30px;">2. Stratovolcanoes (Composite Volcanoes)</h2>
    <p>Stratovolcanoes are characterized by their steep, conical shape and are built up by alternating layers of lava flows, ash, and other volcanic debris. They often produce explosive eruptions. Examples include Mount St. Helens in the USA and Mount Fuji in Japan.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style=" font-size: 30px;">3. Cinder Cone Volcanoes</h2>
    <p>Cinder cone volcanoes are small, steep-sided volcanoes built from volcanic debris called cinders or scoria. They typically have short-lived eruptions and are often found on the flanks of larger volcanoes. An example is Parícutin in Mexico.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style=" font-size: 30px;">4. Lava Domes</h2>
    <p>Lava domes are formed by the slow extrusion of viscous lava that piles up around the vent. They can produce explosive eruptions due to the buildup of pressure. An example is the Novarupta dome in Alaska.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style=" font-size: 30px;">5. Calderas</h2>   
    <p>Calderas are large, basin-like depressions that form when a volcano collapses after a massive eruption. They can be several kilometers in diameter and often contain lakes. An example is the Yellowstone Caldera in the USA.</p>
